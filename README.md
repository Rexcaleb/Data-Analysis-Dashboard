# Coffee-Chain-Sales-Data-Analysis (Analytics report and dashboard using MS Excel)
## Project Objectives
To perform a comprehensive analysis of the Coffee Chain Sales Data in order to identify key drivers of store performance (sales, profit, margin), optimize product-mix and pricing strategy, highlight under- and over-performing stores and products, and deliver actionable recommendations for improving overall chain profitability and operational efficiency.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/Rexcaleb/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Coffee__Chain___Sales__.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
1.	Which stores (by region, size, location) are contributing most significantly to overall sales and profit — and which are under-performing relative to the chain average?
2.	Which product categories or product lines generate the highest sales and the highest profit margins? Conversely, which generate low margin or low sales and may be candidates for discontinuation or review?
3.	How do sales and profit margins vary over time (by day of week, by month, by season)? Are there identifiable peak times and slow times we should plan for (e.g., promotional offers, staffing)?
4.	What is the relationship between cost of goods sold (COGS) and profit margin across product lines and stores? Are there stores or products with unusually high cost or low margin that need investigation?
5.	Are there any consistent patterns of growth or decline for particular stores or product lines — i.e., which stores are improving and which are slipping?
6.	Given store performance and product mix, can we define benchmarks (e.g., sales per store per month, margin per product) for what “good performance” looks like in this chain?
7.	Are there regional differences (e.g., one region consistently has lower margins or higher sales) that suggest specific regional strategies (localized promotions, cost control, product adaptation)?
8.	If we had to prioritize investments (for example: upgrading a store, launching a new product line, increasing marketing in a region), which would offer the best return based on past data?
9.	How can we monitor future performance effectively (which KPIs should we track) to ensure that after implementing changes we can measure whether sales and margin improvements are happening?

## Process
o	Clean and standardize the dataset: ensure consistency in date/time fields, store identifiers, product categories, cost and revenue numbers, margin calculations.

o	Derive useful variables (e.g., profit margin = (sales – COGS)/sales; average transaction value if transaction counts available; sales growth month-on-month).

o	Provide key summary metrics: total sales, total cost, profit, number of stores, product categories; sales by region/store; product line performance; time period (daily, weekly, monthly) trends.

o	Identify top-performing and bottom-performing stores, product lines and regions.

o	Explore relationships: what store characteristics are linked to higher sales or profit margins.

o	Investigate sub-drivers: product category vs sales and margin; time of day or day of week patterns; cost of goods sold vs margin differences.

o	Segment stores and products by performance buckets (e.g., high-sales vs low-sales, high-margin vs low-margin) to identify characteristic differences.

o	Benchmark across regions or product lines to see best practices and under-performers.

o	Based on findings, recommend where to focus attention: e.g., which stores to up-resource, which product lines to promote or discontinue, pricing or cost control opportunities.

o	Propose KPIs and a monitoring framework to track improvements (e.g., sales per store per day, margin per product line, growth vs benchmark).

## Key Insights

●	Profitability is driven by a small number of markets and core product types

●	Underperforming regions represent the largest opportunity for improvement

●	Product mix optimization can significantly improve margins

●	Seasonal trends should inform staffing, promotions, and inventory planning

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
1.	Focus operational improvements and marketing investment on underperforming markets, particularly the South region
2.	Review pricing and cost structures for high-sales but low-margin products
3.	Promote or bundle high-margin products in low-sales categories to improve mix
4.	Implement seasonal promotions to counter late-year sales declines
5.	Set clear performance benchmarks for markets and product lines

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates the value of leveraging sales data to drive strategic decision-making. By focusing on underperforming markets, optimizing product mix, and monitoring the right KPIs, the coffee chain can improve profitability, reduce risk, and support sustainable growth going forward.
